The difference between a random mating population and inbred population is the way \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is constructed. So for a pair of individuals \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), \\[G_{ij}=\\frac{1}{\\tilde{m}}\\sum_l^{\\tilde{m}}\\frac{(x_{il}-2p_l)(x_{jl}-2p_l)}{2(1+F)p_lq_l}\\] and \\(F=1\\) for inbred lines. Please refer to Chapter 1. Conducting eigenanalysis for \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), see it definition (??). Linear regression analysis for each SNP. 2.2 Protocal for EigenGWAS A simple analysis pipeline written in Rscripts may be found at Rpub and its Shiny demo. Or, try it as below in RStudio runGitHub(&quot;Rshiny&quot;, &quot;gc5k&quot;) 2.3 Protocol for predicted eigenvectors The prediction accuracy can be written as \\[R^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{n_e}{m}}\\] "]
